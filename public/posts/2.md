# Subcontracting Google's Search Engine
### May 30, 2018

I have an embarassing secret to admit as a computer programmer by trade for 2+ years. Until recently, anytime I had to style an element with a box-shadow CSS attribute my brain would default to googling "box shadow generator tool" to which I would then navigate to https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow in order to get a box shadow that I liked. This is embarassing because I had done it a surprising amount of times before I realized that I could just look up what each piece of the attribute contents meant and then skip the step of googling the answer every single time I came across the problem. 

I'm not alone in doing something like this. In fact, I've often noticed this in my peers as well. Once a problem is solved and is somewhere on the internet, it's rather easy to mentally bookmark the search that got you to the answer rather than understanding the actual answer in the first place. Sometimes it's just a matter of _knowing_ that an answer exists out there somewhere and that you found it so you're future self should find it easily as well. It's almost as if you're subcontracting Google's Search Engine to supplement your work. This phenomenon is one of the products of living in an increasingly [distracted culture]()



Intensely googling every problem never gets us past the threshold of having to google every problem.

It shows that we don't really understand the tools we are working with.
