# SSIS Gotcha: 8000 character limit in SSIS parameters and variables
### May 18, 2017

This error can be tricky because it will not manifest itself until you try to deploy to SQL Server. Deploying the project will fail. When you click the failure a message pops up: "Failed to deploy project. For more information, query the operation_messages view for the operation identifier '(id here)'"

Still not very helpful. [This link](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/21504c1c-c8f9-42d3-b4ac-4a9bf5708d7d/ssis-project-deployment-getting-error-query-the-operationmessages-view-for-the-operation?forum=sqlintegrationservices) tells us how to query that operation_messages view. Turns out that SSIS stores a lot of helpful log info in operation messages.

```sql
USE SSISDB;
select * from catalog.operation_messages
where operation_id=160314
```

That's the query I'm using to get to the actual error message which ends up being:

```
Failed to deploy the project. Fix the problems and try again later.
The specified parameter value string is too long. The string must be no more than 8000 characters.
```

To fix this, shorten your query or split it out into multiple parameters or variables and then concatenate them together with an expression task. Underneath the hood, people postulate that Microsoft is using a string type that limits it at 8000 rather than using a string type that can handle more because who needs more than 8000 characters for a query? Turns out this happens a lot in the real world.
