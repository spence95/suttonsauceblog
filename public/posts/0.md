# SSIS Gotcha: Script Tasks Require SSDT Installation
### May 18, 2017

This error is quite nefarious; it doesn't manifest until you've deployed your solution and tried to run it. Script tasks are all the rage with SSIS because it gives you quite a bit more power. Make sure you have SSDT installed on the machine you're running your packages or you'll get this mysterious error:

"Script Task:Error: There was an exception while loading Script Task from XML: System.Exception: The Script Task "(insert large id here)" uses version 14.0 script that is not supported in this release of Integration Services. To run the package, use the Script Task to create a new VSTA script..."

The solution? Just install [SSDT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-2017). That's it.
